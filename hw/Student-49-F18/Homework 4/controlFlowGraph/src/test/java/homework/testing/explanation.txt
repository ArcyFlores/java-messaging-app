Based on my test suite the code should be accepted,
since I am directly testing expected functionality,
according to the documentation and given examples.

However, the code does not count spaces after a string,
ex: "  a,  b,  c  ", although this string contains 4 contiguous spaces,
the example(String input) method only outputs 3 since it doesn't count the
contiguous spaces after the c.

Based on the documentation, it's unclear if this is the expected
functionality, or if this is an overlooked error.
