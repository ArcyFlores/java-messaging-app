The TestingHomeworkImpl should be rejected since based on the API, it
doesn't correctly cover all cases for potential outputs
and doesn't account for accurately outputting the
correct answer.

For example, the sqr() method is meant to output only
values of type int but given two large significant
integer values, an int as an output would not accurately
reflect the true values since the int would not contain
enough memory to hold said values.

Furthermore, other functions, like sqrt() do not have exceptions
to handle negative values or any other abstract data types to handle
imaginary numbers, according to the API.
