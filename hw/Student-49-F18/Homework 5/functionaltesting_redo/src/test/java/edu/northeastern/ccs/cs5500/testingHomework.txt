The TestingHomeworkImpl should be rejected since based on the API, it
doesn't correctly cover all cases for potential outputs
and doesn't account for accurately outputting the
correct answer.

For example, the sqr() method is meant to output only
values of type int but given two large significant
integer values, an int as an output would not accurately
reflect the true values since the int would not contain
enough memory to hold said values.

The same can be said for factorial(), sumUp(), and simpleFunctionXplusY.
The code should have some sort of error handling for bigger integer values
to correctly handle integer overflow and underflow where the resulting output
is too small to represent with type int. It could either output an Illegal
Argument exception for values that could result in integer overflow, or could
throw RunTimeExceptions for these cases.

Furthermore, other functions, like sqrt() do not have exceptions
to handle negative values or any other abstract data types to handle
imaginary numbers, according to the API. Similarly, factorial() should
throw exceptions when negative integers are inputted and sumUp() should
also have some error handling for invalid inputs, mainly negative integers.
